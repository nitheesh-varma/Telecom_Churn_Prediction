• Analyzed the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify the relationship between the customer’s characteristics and churn.

• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data cleaning, Feature Engineering and utilized various plots like boxplots, violin
plots, bar plots etc. to display the data visualizations of the Churn analysis and relationships between various features.

• Explored four types of tree-based Machine Learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forests, ADA Boost and
Gradient Boosted trees to predict whether a customer will churn.

• Performed Hyperparameter tuning and documented the performance of each model through classification report and by
plotting the confusion matrix.
